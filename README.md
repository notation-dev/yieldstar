# YieldStar 🤘

JavaScript-native distributed workflows.

Write workflows as async generator functions that yield steps. First-class primitives for retries, delays, polling, and durable stores.

## Install

```sh
bun add yieldstar
```

Runtime packages:

- Local execution: `@yieldstar/worker-invoker`, `@yieldstar/sqlite-runtime`
- HTTP server: `@yieldstar/http-server`, `@yieldstar/worker-invoker`

Select `@yieldstar/sqlite-runtime/bun` for `bun:sqlite` or `@yieldstar/sqlite-runtime/node` for `node:sqlite`.

## Quick Look

Define a workflow that composes steps:

```ts
import { workflow } from "yieldstar";

export const simple = workflow(async function* (step) {
  const n = yield* step.run(() => 1);
  yield* step.delay(1000);
  return yield* step.run(() => n * 2);
});
```

Retries are explicit and structured:

```ts
import { RetryableError } from "yieldstar";

yield* step.run(async () => {
  // e.g. flaky fetch
  throw new RetryableError("temporary", { maxAttempts: 4, retryInterval: 1000 });
});
```
